# Sparky's Store

# I want an intro to what it is that is going on 
# "Welcome to Sparkys Store, date etc" 
# I want to present the user with what the store has avalable and where they can go 
# places they could go would be in isles; Isle 1: pharmacy, Isle 2: snacks, Isle 3: drinks, Isle 4: bakery, Isle 5: dairy, Isle 6: Meats 
# i wanna setup a simple things that tells the user where they are and where their options are 
# The user needs a wallet with a set balance as they walk in so they have a limit 
# every item needs its own prices, make them reasonable 
# if a user cant afford something let them know they can and ask them if they wanna pay 
# the user needs a shopping cart list with them that they can check as they need to with prices of everything and the total price too 
# once the user has finished getting everthing they want they then need to checkout. 
# checkout just calculates the total price of everything together and prints a receipt 
# once user has checked out the store then says goodbye and the code finishes
