# ##DETAILED EXPLANATION:

# # This code prints numbers from 1 to 10 but stops when it reaches 5.
# number = 1 # Initialize number to 1
# while number <= 10: # Loop while number is less than or equal to 10
#     print(number) # Print the current number
#     if number == 5: # Check if the number is 5
#         break
#     number += 1 # Increment number by 1
# # If number is 5, the loop breaks and stops executing further.

# number = 0 # Initialize number to 0
# while number <= 10: # Loop while number is less than or equal to 10
#     number += 1 # Increment number by 1
#     if number == 5: # Check if the number is 5
#         print(f"This is the number {number}") # Print a special message for number 5
