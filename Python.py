# this is a comment
# this file im going to learn how to put comments and use the print function
# print must always be lowercase
# dont indent a print
print ("Hello World :D")  # This is an inline comment
"""comment"""  # This is a comment

# for a new line (only for print function) put a \n
print ("line 1 \nline 2") 

# for a 'tab in' use \t (also only for print function)
print ("test 1 \ttest 2")

# If using single quotes, if you are using a ' in your word you must use a \
# print ('It\'s a lovely day')  works but,
# print ('It's a lovely day')   doesnt work

# use ' if you are using " in your print functions and use a \ if you are using ' in a word
print('It is "warm"')
print ('It\'s "warm"')
print ("It\'s warm")
print ('It\'s warm')

# When putting in a directory like C:\User\Name, you need to use two back slashes
print ('go to C:\\Users\\frg45') # this will work

# For indenting print words use \t for as many indents as you want
print("No indent")
print("\tOne indent")
print("\t\tTwo indents")
